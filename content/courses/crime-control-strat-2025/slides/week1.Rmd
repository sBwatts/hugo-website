## The Criminal Justice System (CJS)

--
- Do the police effect crime levels?

--

- Does the court system control crime?

--

- Does the correctional system control crime?

## Other Interventions

--

- Do community members informally (or formally) help reduce crime?

--

- What about the physical environment? Does improved lighting reduce victimization rates?

--

- Does gun shot detection systems help police respond quicker and apprehend offenders?

--

- Does employment lead to reductions in offending?

# Politics and Policy
Mays & Ruddell (2019) Ch. 1

---

## Why Start with Politics and Policy?

- The CJS does not exist in a vacuum
  - It exists within a larger structure of legal, political, and social influences

- Shifts between so called "lenient" and "tough-on-crime" policies are largely a result of the political process

- This process plays out across local-, state-, and federal-levels

## What are the Sources of Law?

<div style="position: absolute; top: 2em; right: 1em; width: 400px;">
<img src="bill.png" style="width: 75%;" />

</div>

--

- **Constitutional law**

--

- **Common law**

--

- **Statutory law**

--

- **Case law**

--

- **Administrative (Regulatory) law**


???
- Ex. Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth Amendments
- Ex. Murder: “the killing of another human being with malice aforethought.”
- Ex. Murder (First, Second, Third degree; codified in statute)
- Ex. Tennessee v. Garner (1985)
- Ex. Clean Water Act enforced by Environmental Protection Agency

## What is Public Policy?

> “At its core, policy is a course of action or a direction established by one of the three branches of government—executive, legislative, or judicial— or by the permanent bureaucracy housed in administrative agencies.”

.right[Mays & Ruddell, 2019: p. 5]

---

## What is Public Policy?

--

- **Policy issues**
    - Substantive v. Symbolic

--

- **Actors**
    - High ranking officials, judges, front-line personnel

--

- **Resources**
    - Allocation and distribution

--

- **Institutions**
    - Three branches of government across local-, state-, and federal-levels

???
- symbolic = "quick fixes" (e.g., superficial responses)
- substantive = issues arising from the public
---

## Developing Policy in the CJS

Stages of policy development in the CJS:

</div>

</div>

???
1. Agenda setting
  - whats the problem?

2. Policy formulation
  - development of alternatives to address problem

3. Policy implementation
  - actionable mechanisms to adopt and incorporate alternative response

4. Policy impact
  - did the intervention address the problem?

5. Policy evaluation
  - how effective is the intervention?

6. Policy termination
  - Do we want to keep this approach?

## Example of Policymaking

| **Stage**     | **Example**                                                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem →           | 95% of BWC footage is never reviewed by anyone.                              |
| Formulate →         | Companies offer AI tools to review BWC footage automatically.                |
| Implement →          | Departments adopt AI tools to analyze and transcribe BWC data.               |
| Impact →            | Does the AI process 100% of footage and influence officer behavior?          |
| Evaluate →           | Track platform usage and behavior change metrics.                            |
| Terminate? →         | Determine if the tool is cost-effective and worth continuing.                |

# Crime Control vs. Due Process

???
- Herbert Packer describes these two models as *viewpoints* not correct or wrong models, per se
- A CJS likely embodies both viewpoints; It's not an either or scenario
---

## Comparing the Models

|**Feature**      |**Crime Control Model**    |**Due Process Model**    |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
|Presumption      |Guilty                     |Innocent                 |
|Concern          |False negatives            |False positives          |
|Model metaphor   |Assembly line              |Obstacle course          |
|Examples         |SQF, three-strikes laws, mandatory minimums |Miranda rights, eliminating cash bail, protections against warrantless searches |

--

- Due process is mentioned in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the US Constitution
  - 5th: "No person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."
  - 14th: "No State ... shall deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."
  
- The CJS also moves along the spectrum when culture shifts (e.g., post-George Floyd resulted in a momentous shift towards the due process model)

???
- note the presumption of guilt is not intended to mean that the defendant will receive no trial if they wish, it is a matter of factual guilt (e.g., it is more likely than not that this individual did commit crime x)

# Criminal Justice Policy
Mays & Ruddell (2019) Ch. 3

---

## Understanding Criminal Justice Policy

- Oftentimes policies are irrational, solely influenced by political forces, or not effective
  - In some cases, it's due to all three!

- Why is this the case? Why can't rational policy be the rule and not the exception?

- Lets look at why this may be the case...

???
- As we learned last week these actions are generally impacted by politics, fear, and irrationality
  - life-long sentences for youth who committed non-homicide offenses, for example (Tonry, 2017)
- produced by a host of actors across local, state, and federal levels

---

## Challenges to Having Rational Policies

According to Mears (2010) here are some reasons that rational policy takes the backseat:

.pull-left[
- The politicization of crime

- False dichotomies

- Bad cases make bad policies

- Symbolic gestures
]

.pull-right[
- Public opinion

- Swings between extremes

- limited production of policy research

]

???
- perceived "soft-on-crime" politicians historically do not fare well
- "either or" choices: punishment or rehabilitation
- rare, egregious, and highly publicized cases elicit emotional responses which lead to emotional policy
- symbolic gestures make the public seem something is being done or that legislatures are doing the *right* thing
- The CJS is affected by politics, and politicians respond to the public
- extremes have the loudest voices and get the most air time
- much research is not adequately assessing the causal effect of said policy. Most is correlational and/or descriptive.

## Key Takeaways

- Political processes *do* and *always will* affect the CJS and policy

- Policymaking is complex and produced by many different actors

- CJ policy often falls along a spectrum of two predominate viewpoints (CC vs. DP)
