# What will this course cover?

## The Criminal Justice System (CJS)

- Do the police effect crime levels?
  
- How do the courts control crime?

- Does the correction system control crime? 

## Other Interventions

- How do community members informally (or formally) help reduce crime?

- What about the physical environment? Does improved lighting in dark areas reduce the likelihood of being a victim of crime?

- Does gun shot detection systems help police respond quicker and apprehend offenders?

- Does employment lead to reductions in offending?

# Politics and Policy
Mays & Ruddell (2019) Ch. 1

## Why Start with Politics and Policy?

- The CJS does not exist in a vacuum
  - It exists within a larger structure of legal, political, and social influences

- Shifts between so called "lenient" and "tough-on-crime" policies are largely a result of the political process

- This process plays out across local-, state-, and federal-levels

## What is Public Policy?

<br> 

> “At its core, policy is a course of action or a direction established by one of the three branches of government—executive, legislative, or judicial— or by the permanent bureaucracy housed in administrative agencies.”

## Example of Policymaking

<br>

| <span style="padding-right:1em;"><strong>Stage</strong></span>        | **Example**                                                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem →           | 95% of BWC footage is never reviewed by anyone.                              |
| Formulate →         | Companies offer AI tools to review BWC footage automatically.                |
| Implement →          | Departments adopt AI tools to analyze and transcribe BWC data.               |
| Impact →            | Does the AI process 100% of footage and influence officer behavior?          |
| Evaluate →           | Track platform usage and behavior change metrics.                            |
| Terminate? →         | Determine if the tool is cost-effective and worth continuing.                |


## Key Takeaways

- Politics *do* and *always will* affect the CJS and policy

- Policymaking is complex and is produced by many different actors

- Rigorous evaluation of policies is important to assess their effectiveness
